- Polar TOS
- Last updated 22 Sep 2023
We collect your data, for Discord. We cannot control the TOS and we probably may collect user data, entered text, and other data you send.
We (may) include your username, discriminitor (aka Tag), and your data, onto our servers.
We also can control your usage of the bot.
